Welcome to Pandantic's documentation!
=====================================

**Pandantic** introduces the ability to validate (``pandas``) DataFrames using
``pydantic.BaseModel``s. The `pandantic` package is a fork of the ``2.x.x`` version of
`pydantic` as it has significant improvements over its ``1.x.x`` versions
(a performance increase up to 50 times).

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
