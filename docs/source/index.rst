Welcome to Pandantic's documentation!
=====================================

Gone are the days of black-box dataframes in otherwise type-safe code!

Pandantic builds off the Pydantic API to enable validation and filtering of the usual dataframe types (i.e., pandas, etc.)

The `pandantic` package is using the V2 version of pydantic as it has significant improvements over its V1 versions (a performance increase up to 50 times).
